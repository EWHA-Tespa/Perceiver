Once magnetized, they behave like floating solid magnets, spinning and dancing with each other, and form a stable hydrodynamic pattern, resulting from the balance between vortex-vortex repulsion and magnetic attraction to the center of the magnet rotating underneath. A small drop of a dye solution (Nile Red) was added to the oil to track the flow field around the rotating ferromagnetic liquid droplets. The video is recorded from top view and played in real time.
